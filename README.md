# How to Play
You've just entered the world as a delivery driver to make some money! But how do you drive?
To turn your wheels use the "A" and "D" keys, doing so will allow you to steer and avoid those magnetic light posts.
To move forward press "W" and reverse "S". If you're already moving forward pressing "S" will slow you down until you stop, conversely if you're already moving backward pressing "W" will slow you down to a stop.
If you need extra braking power pressing and holding "Space" will help slow the car down even more.
To look around you and take in the scenery move the mouse around and the camera will follow along.

If you need to pause the game press "esc" will bring up the pause menu which you can access the buy menu for new cars, the upgrade menu for upgrading aspects of your car, the settings menu to adjust the sensitivity of your mouse and the exit button to close the application and take a break from your new job.

In the Buy menu you can purchase new vehicles which can be an improvement over your current vehicle, though some vehicles do weigh more than others based on their size.
In the upgrades, there are a total of four engine upgrades which will increase your top speed of the vehicle and four tire upgrades which will increase your braking power to help you slow down faster.

When you start driving around you may notice a yellow square on the minimap corresponding to an orange pillar in the game which is either a delivery start position or end position depending on if youâ€™re in a delivery already or not. You can see your current position above the minimap which tells you where you currently are, a speedometer in the lower right corner along with your current money above the speedometer. When in a mission a UI will popup with relevant information about the delivery and a timer will appear in the upper right corner telling you the current time spent on the mission as well as the mission goal location which will also be updated on the minimap.
